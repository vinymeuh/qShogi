# qShogi - Just another shogi game written in Qt

qShogi is a program I written to study and play [Shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi) on my Linux box. For the moment it has very basic **features**:

* Play human vs human
* Play Handicap Shogi

BTW it is also a mean for me to learn C++ and the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/) therefore the quality of the code is certainly of beginner level.


## Installation

qShogi depends on Qt 6.2 or greater with Qt SVG module. See the [Releases](https://github.com/vinymeuh/qShogi/releases) page to download binary.

* Arch Linux

```
pacman -S qt6-declarative qt6-svg
```

## Building from source

See [Building qShogi](docs/Build.md) for more information on how to build qShogi from sources.
